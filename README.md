# Invisible-Cloak
we will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation.
Why Red?
Sure, we could have used green or any other color also.
ALOGRITHM:
1. Capture and store the background frame [ This will be done for some seconds ]
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask. [ used in code ]
4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect. [ video.mp4 ]
